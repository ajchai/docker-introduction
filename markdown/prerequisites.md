### Some hints
* You will find the slides here: [http://npalm.github.io/docker-introduction/](http://npalm.github.io/docker-introduction/)
- Navigation through the slides is easy, just use your arrow keys. Left and right for going to the previous or next section and up and down for previous or next page. The space bar always give you the next page.
- All code blocks are meant to execute by your self unless mention otherwise.
- Have fun, take your time, and feel free to ask questions.

### Tmux cheatsheet - Just handy
Tmux lets you switch easily between several programs in one terminal, detach them (they keep running in the background) and reattach them to a different terminal.
```
Ctrl-b c      : creates a new window
Ctrl-b n      : go to next window
Ctrl-b p      : go to previous window
Ctrl-b "      : split window top/bottom
Ctrl-b %      : split window left/right
Ctrl-b Alt-1  : rearrange windows in columns
Ctrl-b Alt-2  : rearrange windows in rows
Ctrl-b arrows : navigate to other windows
Ctrl-b d      : detach session
tmux attach   : reattach to session
```
